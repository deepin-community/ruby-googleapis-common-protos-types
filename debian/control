Description: Common protobuf types used in Google APIs
 Google APIs are typically deployed as API services that are hosted under
 different DNS names. One API service may implement multiple APIs and multiple
 versions of the same API.
 .
 Google APIs use Protocol Buffers version 3 (proto3) as their Interface
 Definition Language (IDL) to define the API interface and the structure of the
 payload messages. The same interface definition is used for both REST and RPC
 versions of the API, which can be accessed over different wire protocols.
